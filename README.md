# Airfoil-Plotting-and-Analysis
Plots any 4 digit NACA Airfoil and also runs an XFoil Analysis.

Takes a 4-digit NACA Airfoil Code from the user as input. It can be an unsymmetrical or symmetrical airfoil.

Uses the airfoil equations and generates a matplotlib window with the airfoil plotted.

Enters the code into XFoil and runs a basic analysis of the airfoil behaviour within a certain AoA range and generates multiple plots.
